# DATE: 19.08.2025
# REG NO: 212222080013

# AIM:
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

# ALGORITHM:
# Step 1: Define Prompt Categories
Identify:
•	Broad prompts
•	Basic prompts
•	Advanced prompting patterns
# Step 2: Select Test Scenarios
Choose scenarios such as:
•	Summarization
•	Logical reasoning
•	Creative tasks
•	Technical explanations
# Step 3: Generate Responses
For each scenario:
1.	Provide a broad prompt
2.	Provide a refined (basic) prompt
3.	Provide advanced pattern prompts (persona, CoT, few-shot)
# Step 4: Evaluate Responses
Analyze based on:
•	Accuracy
•	Clarity
•	Depth
•	Creativity
•	Relevance
•	Structure
# Step 5: Document Differences
Prepare comparative tables showing how prompting type affects quality.
# Step 6: Conclude Findings
Summarize which prompting pattern performs best in each scenario.

# PROMPTS:
# Prompt Type 1: Zero-Shot Prompt
Prompt:
"Summarize the article on 'The Basics of Blockchain Technology' in simple terms."
Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Output: ChatGPT explained blockchain as a digital ledger where transactions are recorded in linked blocks, secured by cryptography, and used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
Tool B: Gemini (Google)
Output: Gemini described blockchain as a decentralized network that stores data transparently across many computers, emphasizing its use in secure transactions.

# Prompt Type 2: Few-Shot Prompt
Prompt:
"Using the tech summaries as examples, briefly explain 'The Basics of Blockchain Technology.'"
Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Output: ChatGPT explained blockchain as a secure digital system where data is stored in linked blocks across many computers, helping make transactions safe and transparent.
Tool B: Gemini (Google)
Output: Gemini described blockchain as a public, decentralized ledger that records transactions securely and is widely used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

# Prompt Type 3: Chain-of-Thought Prompt
Prompt:
"What is blockchain? How does it work? Where is it used? Summarize clearly."
Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Output: ChatGPT explained blockchain stepwise — a chain of blocks storing transactions, secured by cryptography, validated by a network, used in digital currencies and beyond.
Tool B: Gemini (Google)
Output: Gemini broke down blockchain into components, describing its decentralized ledger, security features, and real-world uses like supply chain and finance.

# Prompt Type 4: Role-Based Prompt
Prompt:
"Explain 'The Basics of Blockchain Technology' as if you are a professor teaching first-year students."
Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Output: ChatGPT used a friendly, teaching tone: described blockchain as a tamper-proof digital notebook shared across many computers, highlighting examples like Bitcoin.
Tool B: Gemini (Google)
Output: Gemini took a formal educator approach, explaining blockchain’s cryptographic basis and network consensus, using terms suitable for an introductory lecture.

# RESULT:
The evaluation of different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across AI platforms ChatGPT and Gemini showed varied strengths. ChatGPT excelled in simplicity, clarity, and emotional engagement, making it ideal for beginner-friendly and educational summaries. Gemini offered more formal, abstract, and detailed outputs, suitable for advanced users and deeper insights. Selecting the best prompting approach depends on the user’s needs for accuracy, coherence, simplicity, and context.
